```lrc
[00:35.89] Lie awake in bed at night
[00:40.01] And think about your life
[00:43.13] Do you want to be different?
[00:57.13] 
[00:47.87] Try to let go of the truth
[00:52.05] The battles of your youth
[00:55.02] 'Cause this is just a game
[01:08.02] 
[00:57.82] It's a beautiful lie
[01:03.78] It's a perfect denial
[01:09.79] Such a beautiful lie to believe in
[01:17.30] So beautiful, beautiful lie makes me
[01:35.30] 
[01:23.53] It's time to forget about the past
[01:27.86] To wash away what happened last
[01:36.06] Hide behind an empty face
[01:39.99] Don't ask too much, just say
[01:42.92] 'Cause this is just a game
[01:55.92] 
[01:45.78] It's a beautiful lie
[01:51.88] It's a perfect denial
[01:57.66] Such a beautiful lie to believe in
[02:05.33] So beautiful, beautiful lie makes me
[02:12.53] Lie
[02:14.03] 
[02:22.34] Beautiful
[02:26.84] 
[02:36.07] Everyone's looking at me
[02:39.46] I'm running 'round in circles (Plagued with)
[02:45.49] A quiet desperation's building higher
[02:52.28] I've got to remember this is just a game
[03:12.28] 
[02:59.63] So beautiful, beautiful (Lie)
[03:03.96] So beautiful lie (So beautiful, beautiful)
[03:10.10] So beautiful lie (So beautiful, beautiful)
[03:16.27] So beautiful lie (So beautiful, beautiful)
[03:37.27] 
[03:21.88] It's a beautiful lie
[03:27.91] It's a perfect denial
[03:33.87] Such a beautiful lie to believe in
[03:41.70] So beautiful, beautiful lie makes me
