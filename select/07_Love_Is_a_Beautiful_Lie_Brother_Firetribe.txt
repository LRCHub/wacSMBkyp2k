There was a time when love was blind
Back then we were out of our minds
The dreams we had turned out too wild
The world got swept under our feet
Love is a lie, love is a beautiful lie

We shared our dreams in one heart beat,
We thought we could not drift apart
The plans we had were built too steep
And now they come crumbling down
Love is a lie, love is a beautiful lie

Sometimes we win, sometimes we hurt and our hearts ache
And we can't tell the nights from the days
How many times, how many ways
Can our hearts break cause I don't know how much we can take

Love is a lie, love is a beautiful lie

I ask myself what could I have done
To stop us from drifting apart
Now it's too late for tears and
I'm missing a piece of my heart,
I'm falling hard
Love has no safety nets, life's full of empty bets,
Our life is a merry-go-round

And love is a lie, love is a beautiful lie

Sometimes we win, sometimes we hurt and our hearts ache
And we can't tell the nights from the days
How many times, how many ways
Can our hearts break cause I don't know how much we can take

Love is a lie, love is a beautiful lie

Now the time stands still
Every hour goes by like a million years
I keep on going back to the times we had
Again and again

Sometimes we win, sometimes we hurt and our hearts ache
And we can't tell the nights from the days
How many times, how many ways
Can our hearts break cause I don't know how much we can take

Love is a lie, love is a beautiful lie
Yeah, love is a lie, love is a beautiful lie
