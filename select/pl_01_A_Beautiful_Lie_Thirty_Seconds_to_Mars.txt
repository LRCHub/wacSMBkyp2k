Lie awake in bed at night
And think about your life
Do you want to be different? (To
be different?)
Try to let go of the truth
The battles of your youth
'Cause this is just a game
It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe
in
So beautiful, beautiful it makes
me
It's time to forget about the
past
To wash away what happened last
(What happened last)
Hide behind an empty face
Don't ask too much, just say
'Cause this is just a game
It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe
in
So beautiful, beautiful it makes
me lie
The end of the world
Everyone's looking at me
I'm runnin' around in circles,
baby (Baby)
A quiet desperation's building
higher
I've got to remember this is
just a game
(So beautiful, beautiful)
(Lie)
It's a beautiful lie (Lie)
(So beautiful, beautiful)
It's a beautiful lie (Lie)
(So beautiful, beautiful)
It's a beautiful lie (Lie)
(So beautiful, beautiful)
It's a beautiful lie (So
beautiful, beautiful)
It's a perfect denial (So
beautiful, beautiful)
Such a beautiful lie to believe
in
So beautiful, beautiful it makes
me
